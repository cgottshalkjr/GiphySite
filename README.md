GIF IN A JIFF:

This is a web applications that has an initial amount of buttons displayed when the user visits the website. Each button that is clicked should bring up 10 gifs associated with that button. Each the same fixed height. The gifs only animate once the user clicks on them. And by clicking on the gif again, you can make it go back to still.
The user can also enter a movie, actor, director in the search bar(really you can enter anything) and a new button will emerge and once clicked it will share the same function as the original buttons.
I used the GIPHY API to connect to my site to grab the gifs. I created mostly all of the elements on the page, buttons and such, dynamically using jQuery. Using ajax to get the information from the GIPHY API. Making different functions to render buttons and display the gifs in divs in the html.
